# What is fitting about?

During your training process, the network learns on the given data. The speed and amount it learns is dependend on many parameters. The one we are looking at here is the epoch. So what does epoch mean and how does it influence the learning-process?
The training loop consists of several steps (compare the pytorch tutorial page: https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/trainingyt.html):
- Loading the data
- Calculating predictions from the input batch
- Compares the predictions with the labeld data (calculating a loss)
- Calculates the backward greadients over the learning weights
